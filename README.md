# Name Compatibility App

## Description

This iOS app predicts the name compatibility between two names and provides the result in percentages. It consists of two views: the first view contains two input fields for entering the "Name" and "Partner's Name," along with a button labeled "See Result." When the user taps the button, it navigates to the second view, which displays the compatibility percentage.
